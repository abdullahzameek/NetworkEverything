## A Useful Iot Device

The reason why I think this is useful purely because of personal reasons - there have many times when I was lazy to get off my bed to 
switch off my lights, or when I leave my room in a hurry and forget to turn off my lights. Additionally, this allows you to dim lights 
depending on the light intensity during the day. Additionally, it works well in an ecosystem of IoT devices which means that you could 
potentially have it **networked** in some way with another device.
