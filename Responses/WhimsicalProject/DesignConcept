## Wifi-Controlled Jukebox (?)

So, recently I was playing around with my old Arduino Uno after I discovered a sound library for Processing called Minim. After consulting
a few online tutorials, I found a few to make LEDs blink in sync to a particular track being played.
My idea now, is to extend my previous project and make it in such a way it can be controlled from a webpage, and hopefully 
play more than one tune. Initially, I had to use StandardFirmata in conjunction with my Processing Sketch, but I hope that
I can find a workaround that doesn't involve the very un-friendly Firmata library programs.
For now, I have a concept in mind - one that might be a bit audacious at this stage, but I still want to give a shot and see how it 
goes.
For the time being, I'll upload a short video of what my wired prototype looks like.
