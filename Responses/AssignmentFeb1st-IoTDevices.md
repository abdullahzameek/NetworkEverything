## A Useful IoT Device

The reason why I think this is useful purely because of personal reasons - there have many times when I was lazy to get off my bed to 
switch off my lights, or when I leave my room in a hurry and forget to turn off my lights. Additionally, this allows you to dim lights 
depending on the light intensity during the day. Additionally, it works well in an ecosystem of IoT devices which means that you could 
potentially have it **networked** in some way with another device.

## A Useless IoT Device

It's the year 2018, and human laziness has just reached unimaginable heights. Presenting - the smart egg tray! I was honestly shocked at the amount of time and effort put into making this absurd device. The device can track how many eggs you have in your tray and when the eggs are expiring. Honestly, the time it would take to do this through an app would be the same as opening the refrigerator to count your eggs or check the expiry date on the box.
